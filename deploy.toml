# This file contains config for a baremetal deployment
#
# SSH connection options include:
#
# * host - the remote server hostname/IP
# * port - defaults to 22
# * username - required, the user you're connecting as
# * password - only set if you're not using key-based authentication
# * privateKey - a Buffer containing the private key (use this _or_ 'privateKeyPath', not both)
# * privateKeyPath - local file path to a private key that will be sent with the connection request
# * passphrase - used if your private key has a passphrase
# * agentForward - set to `true` to forward the client machine's ssh credentials
#
# See https://redwoodjs.com/docs/deploy/baremetal for more info
